        <p>The popular wildlife destination in India, Ranthambore National Park remains open between October and June.
            The
            winter season between October and March is considered the best time to visit Ranthambore National Park due
            to
            the pleasant weather condition when the temperature ranges between comfortable 10℃ and 30℃. During this
            season,
            animals can be seen in the broad daylight basking under the sun.</p>
        <p>
            In the months between April and June (summer season), Ranthambore experiences hot and humid weather with
            mercury
            rising up to 40℃. The month of April is still comfortable with temperatures not exceeding more than 30 -
            35℃.
            However, May and June are extremely hot months. During the summers though, one has more chances of sighting
            tigers and other animals who frequently have to visit the water holes to keep themselves hydrated.</p>
        <p>
            In the monsoon season between July and September, many of the zones of Ranthambore National Park remain
            closed
            for the visitors. The core of the national park with Gates 1 to 5 remain closed in the monsoon; the buffer
            zone
            with Gate 6 to 10 remain open in this season. </p>
        <p>The park is green after the monsoon and wildlife is abundant. You can also see many migratory birds that come
            to Ranthambore to spend the winter. If you wear adequate protective clothing, the wind chill aspect will not
            be a bother, even in the early morning or late evening. If the summer heat is not unbearable for you, summer
            can be a very fruitful time to visit Ranthambore National Park since the animals can be clearly seen in the
            leaf-denuded forests and along the lakes and watering holes as they are driven by thirst to the water's
            edge. </p>
