                    Sawai Madhopur    <hr>

                <p>
                    The gateway to Ranthambore, Sawai Madhopur is a city in Rajasthan that has primarily found its
                    popularity due to the wildlife destination, Ranthambore National Park, which is located in close
                    proximity.Apart from its close proximity to Ranthambore National Park, Sawai Madhopur is also the
                    neighbour to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, Ranthambore Fort. Along with this, the tourist place in
                    Rajasthan has few religious fairs & festivals like the annual Sawai Madhopur Utsav, Ganesh Chaturthi
                    Fair, Dussehra and Chauth Mata Mela that are a must see.

                <h3>
                    Jaipur        <hr>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    When Sawai Jai Singh II built Jaipur (the capital city of Rajasthan), he wanted to give it a
                    distinct appearance. That distinctness can be strongly seen in its architecture. Sightseeing tourism
                    in Jaipur involves visiting the Amber Palace, City Palace, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar and other
                    historic structures.Jaipur is a major tourist attraction for the first-time visitors of India. The
                    Old City (Known as the Pink City) is a great place to wander around. Jaipur & its surroundings are
                    rather like an endless museum.

                    Named after the massive Chittorgarh Fort, the city of Chittorgarh is a popular tourist destination
                    in Rajasthan.The major attraction of the city is inarguably Chittorgarh Fort, which is considered
                    the largest fort complex in India with a total area of 700 acres. In Chittorgarh Fort, the biggest
                    Rajput Festival, Jauhar Mela is held annually on the anniversary of one of the jauhars
                    (self-immolation of the women of Chittorgarh during three invasions in the fort). The festival
                    commemorates the bravery of Rajput ancestors and all three jauhars.
