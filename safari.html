        <p>The Safari Timings in Ranthambore National Park for both the entry & exit varies according to the season,
            whether it is the summer season or the winter season. During the winters, the daylight hours are shorter
            while during the summers, the daylight hours are longer. The entry timings in the park begin a little
            later during the summers, and same is the case with exit timings.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, the morning safari starts half an hour after sunrise and the evening safari finishes
            half an hour before sunset. As a result, the timings change slightly every 2 months or so. Each safari
            is for duration of three to three and half hours.Winter daytime temperatures are a pleasant 16-20
            degrees and are ideal for touring the Ranthambore National Park.Further details are available on the
            chart below.</p>
