                After completing this project on the topic DUMMY WEBSITE OF A WILDLIFE SANCUTUARY USING HTML & CSS I
                can conclude that I really enjoyed making the project and also got to know about new kind of programs
                which enhanced my learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project includes true facts & information which increases its realibility. Now I am able to talk
                on any issue related with HTML & CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The whole credit goes to my subject teacher for teaching me how to do programming, my family & friends
                refined my ideas and helped me in making this project wonderful.
