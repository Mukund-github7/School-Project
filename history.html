        <h1>History Of Ranthambore National Park
            <hr color="green" width="95%">
        </h1>
        <p>Ranthambore National Park was established initially as Sawai Madhopur Game Sanctuary in 1955 by the
            Government of India. In 1973, it was declared as one of the Project Tiger reserves in India. It was on 1st
            November, 1980 that Ranthambore was declared a national park, while the forests located beside it were named
            Sawai Man Singh Sanctuary & Keladevi Sanctuary.</p>
        <p> Ranthambore National Park is dotted with structures that remind you of bygone eras. A huge fort, after which
            the park is named, towers over the park atop a hill. There are many ruins of bygone eras scattered all over
            the jungle, which give it a unique, wonderful and mixed flavour of nature, history and wildlife. </p>
